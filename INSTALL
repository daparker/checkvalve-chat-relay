INSTALLATION:

In the steps below, please use the following substitutions:

* Replace <INSTALL_PATH> with the actual path under which you
  are installing the Chat Relay (ex: /usr/local).

* Replace VERSION with the version number (ex: 1.2.0)

* Replace XYZ with "amd64-jre", "i586-jre", or "noarch" depending on which file
  you downloaded.

1. Extract the tar file:

    cd <INSTALL_PATH>
    tar -zxvf checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION-linux-XYZ.tar.gz

2. Edit the following scripts and set the value of the BASEDIR variable in each:

    <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/bin/start.sh
    <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/bin/stop.sh
    <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/etc/init.d/checkvalvechatrelay

3. Optionally set the CONFIG_FILE variable in one of these scripts:

    <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/bin/start.sh
    <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/etc/init.d/checkvalvechatrelay

    NOTE: This is only necessary if you wish to run the CheckValve Chat Relay
          with a properties file other than the default.

4. Edit the properties file to configure the Chat Relay (by default this is
   <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/checkvalvechatrelay.properties)

5. Start the chat relay:

    cd <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/etc/init.d
    ./checkvalvechatrelay start

6. If you would like the Chat Relay to start when the system boots, run the
   following as root (or use 'sudo'):

    cd <INSTALL_PATH>/checkvalvechatrelay-VERSION/etc/init.d
    cp checkvalvechatrelay /etc/init.d
    insserv checkvalvechatrelay
