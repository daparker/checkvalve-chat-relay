CheckValve Chat Relay
=====================

The CheckValve Chat Relay allows client devices such as mobile phones to receive
chat messages from HLDS/SRCDS servers.  It is a cross-platform program developed
in Java, which basically does three things:

1. Listens for connection requests from client devices
2. Listens for log messages coming from HLDS/SRCDS servers
3. Parses the log messages and sends chat messages to clients
